                    <li>Progressive rates: the higher the income, the higher the rate (e.g., US, Germany).</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Self-Employment Tax</h5>
                <ul>

                    <li>Example: In the US, the self-employment tax is 15.3%.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>This defines which taxes to pay and what reports to submit.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>VAT rate: 19%.</li>
                    <li>Total invoice amount: €2,000 + (€2,000 * 0.19) = €2,380.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Example 2: Freelancer in the US</h5>
                <p>A California-based freelancer earns $5,000 per month. They must consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Income tax (e.g., 24%).</li>
                    <li>Self-employment tax (15.3%).</li>
                    <li>Total tax = $5,000 * (0.24 + 0.153) = $1,865.</li>
                </ul>
